				<h2>CONSIDERATIONS FOR FEDERAL REGISTRATION WHEN 
SELECTING A MARK</h2>
				<p>Once you determine that the type of protection you need is, in fact, trademark protection, then selecting a mark is the very first step in the overall application/registration process. This must be done with thought and care, because not every mark is registrable with the USPTO. Nor is every mark legally protectable, that is, some marks may not be capable of serving as the basis for a legal claim by the owner seeking to stop others from using a similar mark on related goods or services. </p>
